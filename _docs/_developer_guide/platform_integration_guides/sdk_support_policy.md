# SDK Support Policy

This article outlines the timing and definitions of Braze's SDK support policy.

## Definitions

**Deprecated** - SDK versions which are deprecated have a known end-of-life date in the future.

**End-Of-Life Date** - Braze will no longer support an older SDK after its end-of-life date.

## SDK Support Timelines

Braze supports each SDK version for at least one year following a newer versionâ€™s release. Once a newer version of an SDK is released, its previous version will have an __end-of-life date__ in 12 months. 

For example if Android SDK version 20.1.5 is released on May 25th 2026, then its previous version, 20.1.4  will no longer be supported as of May 25th, 2027.

Before an SDK's __end-of-life date__ you can expect Braze will attempt to resolve bugs, provide fixes, answer questions and generally support a given SDK version to the best we possibly can.

After an SDK version reaches its __end-of-life date__, Braze will no longer continue to troubleshoot integration issues, or otherwise support that version.

We encourage you to always update to the latest recommended versions of our SDKs when you are making updates to your relevant apps and services. Using newer versions will help ensure a longer support timeline, and best of all, access to the latest and greatest Braze features.
