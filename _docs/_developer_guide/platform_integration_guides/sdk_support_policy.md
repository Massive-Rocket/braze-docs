# SDK Support Policy

This article describes Braze's SDK support policy and relevant timelines.

## Definitions

An SDK version's **end-of-life date** is the date at which Braze no longer supports that version. An SDK version's __end-of-life date__ will be 1 year after its next version is released.

SDK versions which are **deprecated** are still fully supported, but have a known __end-of-life date__ in the future. For example, if Android SDK version 1.0.1 were released today, then for the next year its previous version (1.0.0) is considered deprecated, and will have an __end-of-life date__ one year from today.

## SDK Support Timelines

Braze supports each version of an SDK for a minimum of one year. Once a newer version of an SDK is released, its previous version(s) will be considered __deprecated__, and will have an __end-of-life date__ in 12 months.

**Before** an SDK version reaches its __end-of-life date__, Braze will:

* Investigate bugs and release new SDK versions with enhancements.
* Answer questions related to this SDK version through usual support channels.

**After** an SDK version reaches its __end-of-life date__, Braze:

* May prevent messages being sent in the case of known bugs for that older SDK version.
* May not be able to provide support, troubleshoot integrations, or answer questions around that older SDK version.

We encourage you to always update to the latest recommended versions of our SDKs when you are making updates to your relevant apps and services. Staying up-to-date on your Braze SDK integration will help ensure a longer support timeline, and best of all, access to the latest and greatest Braze features.
