# SDK Support Policy

This article describes Braze's SDK support policy and relevant timelines.

## Definitions

An SDK version's **end-of-life date** is the date at which Braze no longer supports that version. An SDK version's __end-of-life date__ will be 1 year after its next version is released.

SDK versions which are **deprecated** are still fully supported, but have a known __end-of-life date__ in the future. For example, if Android SDK version 1.0.1 were released today, then for the next year its previous version is considered deprecated, and will have an __end-of-life date__ one year from today.

## SDK Support Timelines

Braze supports each SDK version for at least one year following a newer versionâ€™s release. Once a newer version of an SDK is released, its previous version will be considered __deprecated__, and will have an __end-of-life date__ in 12 months.

**Before** an SDK version reaches its __end-of-life date__, Braze will:

* Investigate bugs and release new SDK versions with enhancements.
* Answer questions related to this SDK version through usual support channels.

**After** an SDK version reaches its __end-of-life date__, Braze:

* No longer guarantees successful message delivery for that older SDK version.
* May not send messages in the case of known bugs for that older SDK version.
* Will not be able to provide support, troubleshoot integrations, or answer questions around that older SDK version.

We encourage you to always update to the latest recommended versions of our SDKs when you are making updates to your relevant apps and services. Staying up-to-date on your Braze SDK integration will help ensure a longer support timeline, and best of all, access to the latest and greatest Braze features.
